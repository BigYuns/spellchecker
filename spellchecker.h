 * Spellchecker Virtual Class
 *
 * Requires implementation of 2 public methods:
 *  isValidWord(string word): given a word, check that it's part
 *      of a dictionary.
 *  guessCorrections(string word): given a word, return a vector
 *      of strings that are possible corrections of the word.
 *      If the word is correct, return empty vector.
 *
 * Note: it is also expected that SpellChecker implementation
 *  expose a constructor that takes in a path to the dictionary it
 *  will use to determine if a word is valid
